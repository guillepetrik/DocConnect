George Villa is an experienced ophthalmologist based in Houston, Texas. With over 14 years of clinical experience, he specializes in comprehensive eye care, including the treatment of cataracts, corneal and retinal disorders, glaucoma, and other eye conditions.
Dr George Villa is an established ophthalmologist, based in Houston, Texas. With over 14 years of clinical experience, he specializes in comprehensive eye care, including the treatment of cataracts, corneal and retinal disorders, glaucoma, and other eye conditions. Dr Villa has attended Baylor College of Medicine and the University of Texas for his education. As a graduate of the Baylor College of Medicine, Dr. George Villa went on to attend the University of Texas, where he obtained his medical degree.
After graduating, Dr. Villa went on and completed a fellowship in medical and surgical ophthalmology at the University of Texas Eye Bank. With years of clinical experience, Dr. George Villa has been a member of the American Society of Ophthalmology, which is a national medical organization, as well as the American Ophthalmologist Society. He is also a member of the Texas Medical Association and the Texas Academy of Ophthalmology.
Dr. Villa’s expertise in ophthalmology allows him to treat various eye conditions that include glaucoma, corneal and retinal disorders, and cataracts. The treatment that Dr. Villa recommends for cataracts is a procedure called a corneal transplant. This is because this is the only permanent cure for cataracts and it has a very high success rating.
The corneal transplant procedure, which is performed by a specialist in ophthalmology, is a simple and safe surgery. The surgery is performed in the ophthalmologists’ own clinic, so that there is no need for a hospital stay. The surgery usually takes about 30 minutes and can be completed in just a few hours.
The most common corneal transplant in this country is the Descemet’s stripping endothelial keratoplasty. In the Descemet’s stripping endothelial keratoplasty, the Descemet’s membrane is removed from the back of the eye. This is done in conjunction with the corneal transplant. The surgeon removes the membrane that separates the Descemet’s membrane from the cornea. This is done to prevent the development of any complications such as infections.
The success of this corneal transplant procedure is a result of the fact that the procedure has a high success rate.
